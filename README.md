# 1. Introduction
In today’s era, where online visibility defines professional success, building a strong personal brand on platforms like LinkedIn has become essential. Whether you are sharing industry insights, celebrating career milestones, or promoting your services, professionals are expected to consistently produce high-quality, engaging content. Yet, crafting compelling LinkedIn posts on a regular basis can be time-consuming, creatively exhausting, and inconsistent especially for those without a background in writing or marketing.
The LinkedIn Post Generator MVP is designed to solve this problem. Powered by open-source large language models (LLMs), the tool enables users to generate personalized, ready-to-publish LinkedIn posts in real time. With just a few inputs such as a topic, set of keywords, or desired tone it delivers well-structured posts tailored to the user’s voice and audience. The MVP is built with speed, simplicity, and customization in mind, making it easy for individuals and teams to create content that aligns with their personal or professional brand.

13. Data Flow and Architecture

# System Architecture
Browser (React) → REST API (FastAPI) → Local/Hosted LLM (Streamlit) → Post-Processing → Response
Client-Server Model


Stateless API


LLM hosted via microservice or external inference API 


No persistent data storage in MVP
# 14. Limitations and Assumptions

# Limitations
No real-time LinkedIn integration in MVP
No user authentication or saving history
AI-generated content is not always fact-checked
Performance may vary based on LLM latency
May not support niche domains (e.g., scientific writing)

# Assumptions
Assumes prompt quality affects generation output (Users provide adequate input )
Open-source LLM runs in an accessible environment
MVP usage is light and doesn’t require scaling (yet)

# 15. Future Scope
LinkedIn API integration for direct posting
User Accounts: Save templates, history
Post Scheduler: Set time/date for auto-publishing
Cross-platform support (X, Instagram, Medium…etc)
Advanced editing (grammar check, image suggestions)
